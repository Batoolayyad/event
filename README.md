## LAB: Event Driven Applications

###  Description:
#### CAPS Phase 1: Begin the build of an application for a company called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, we’ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, be notified that their customers received what they purchased.

Tactically, this will be an event driven application that “distributes” the responsibility for logging to separate modules, using only events to trigger logging based on activity.


#### Phase 1 Requirements
Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the CAPS system, written in Node.js. In this first phase, our goal is to setup a system of events and handlers, with the intent being to change out the eventing system as we go, but keeping the handlers themselves largely the same. The task of “delivering a package” doesn’t change (the handler), even if the mechanism for triggering that task (the event) does.
